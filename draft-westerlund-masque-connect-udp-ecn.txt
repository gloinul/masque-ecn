                      ECN support for Connect-UDP
             draft-westerlund-masque-connect-udp-ecn-latest

Abstract

   HTTP's Extended Connect-UDP protocol enables a client to proxy a UDP
   flow from the HTTP server towards a specified target IP address and
   UDP port.  Both QUIC and RTP are transport protocols that uses UDP
   and have support for using ECN and providing the necessary feedback.
   Thus, there exist a benefit to enable an end-to-end QUIC or RTP
   transport protocol connection/session to be able to use ECN.  This
   document specifies how ECN can be supported through an extension to
   the Connect-UDP protocol for HTTP.

1.  Introduction

   Connect-UDP as currently defined limits the ECN [RFC3168] exchange
   between the HTTP server and the target.  There is no support for
   carrying the ECN bits between the HTTP Connect-UDP client and the
   HTTP server proxying the UDP flow.  Thus, it is not possible to
   establish the end-to-end ECN flow of information necessary to make
   either ECN classic [RFC3168] or L4S [RFC9484].

   To enable ECN usage end-to-end for transport protocols using UDP and
   being proxied using the Connect-UDP extended connect over HTTP
   additional extensions are needed.  This document specified the
   necessary extension, defining a negotiation method and a new context
   that carries the ECN bits and the UDP payload instead of the context
   defined in [RFC9298].
