                      ECN support for Connect-UDP
             draft-westerlund-masque-connect-udp-ecn-latest

Abstract

   HTTP's Extended Connect-UDP protocol enables a client to proxy a UDP
   flow from the HTTP server towards a specified target IP address and
   UDP port.  Both QUIC and RTP are transport protocols that uses UDP
   and have support for using ECN and providing the necessary feedback.
   Thus, there exist a benefit to enable an end-to-end QUIC or RTP
   transport protocol connection/session to be able to use ECN.  This
   document specifies how ECN can be supported through an extension to
   the Connect-UDP protocol for HTTP.

1.  Introduction

   Connect-UDP as currently defined limits the ECN [RFC3168] exchange
   between the HTTP server and the target.  There is no support for
   carrying the ECN bits between the HTTP Connect-UDP client and the
   HTTP server proxying the UDP flow.  Thus, it is not possible to
   establish the end-to-end ECN flow of information necessary to make
   either ECN classic [RFC3168] or L4S [RFC9484].

   To enable ECN usage end-to-end for transport protocols using UDP and
   being proxied using the Connect-UDP extended connect over HTTP
   additional extensions are needed.  This document specified the
   necessary extension, defining a negotiation method and a new context
   that carries the ECN bits and the UDP payload instead of the context
   defined in [RFC9298].

   An alternative to using this extension would be to use Connect-IP
   [RFC9484], however that results in that one carries a full IP header
   between the HTTP client and HTTP server.  That results in
   significantly more overhead compared to this extension that adds one
   byte for containing the ECN bits.

   To define a solution that can be combined with other contexts and
   avoid having to be redefined for each combination with other
   extensions this defines a context ID that indicates that it carries
   the ECN field and then is followed by another Context ID.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECN enabled UDP Proxying Payload

   The HTTP Datagram Payload format is defined in [RFC9484] as depicted
   below.

   UDP Proxying HTTP Datagram Payload {
     Context ID (i),
     UDP Proxying Payload (..)
   }

          Figure 1: ECN enabled UDP Proxying HTTP Datagram Format

   The ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload is defined in the following
   way:

 ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload {
   Reserved(6),
   ECN(2),
   UDP Proxying Payload (..) # Payload per another Context ID definition
 }

              Figure 2: ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload

   Reserved: six bits currently reserved, SHALL be set to zero (0) on
   transmission, and ignored on reception.

   ECN: A two bit field carrying the IP ECN bits as defined by Section 5
   of [RFC3168] to be set or as received on the IP/UDP packet carrying
   the UDP Datagram payload included.

   UDP Proxying Payload: Another UDP Proxying Payload following the ECN
   carrying byte.  This uses another Context ID as negotiated, e.g.
   Context ID 0.  Thus enabling this byte to be combined with any other
   payload.

   This format will use a negotiated context ID that MUST be non-zero.
   It also MUST negotiate what the context ID of the UDP Proxying
   payload included.

4.  Negotiating ECN Usage

   ECN-Context-ID is an Structured Header Field [RFC9651].  Its value is
   a List consisting of zero or more Inner Lists, where the Inner List
   contains two Integer Items.  The Integer Items MUST be non-negative
   as they are context Identifiers as defined by [RFC9298].  The first
   Integer Item is the Context ID being defined, the second Context ID
   is the Context ID for the payload following the ECN byte.

   Note that Context Identifiers are defined as QUIC varints, see
   section 16 of [RFC9000] and do support value up to
   4,611,686,018,427,387,903, which is larger than what an Structure
   Header Integer support, which is limited to 999,999,999,999,999.  We
   forsee no issues with this limitations as context identifiers should
   primiarly be using the single byte representation for efficiency
   reason, i.e. Context Identifers should rarely be above the value 63.

   When the header is included in a Extended Connect Request it indicate
   first of all support for this ECN extension.  Secondly is defines one
   or more context IDs that is defined for requestor to responder
   direction.

   The responder MAY if the request include the ECN-Context-ID header
   include the header in a response.  If included in a response it
   defines the Context ID used in the responder to requestor direction.

   ECN-Context-ID: (1,4), (2,5), (3,0)

                 Figure 3: Example of ECN-Context-ID header

   The above example indicate supoprt of the ECN byte context and
   defines three Context IDs, Context ID=1 is combined with 4, ID=2 with
   Context ID 5 and ID=3 with the default ID=0 as defined in [RFC9298],
   i.e. a plain UDP Payload.

5.  Tunnel and ECN marking interactions

5.1.  Tunnel Endpoint Marking

   The Tunnel Endpoint when receiving an IP/UDP packet that is belonging
   to an Connect-UDP request where the ECN extension is enabled copies
   the the two ECN field bits from the IP header to the ECN field in the
   HTTP datagram payload using an Context ID that has the ECN field.

   A Tunnel endpoint on egress copies the ECN extension field value into
   the IP/UDP packet it creates for this UDP Proxying payload.

   An Tunnel endpoint which is unable to read or set the ECN Field SHALL
   NOT enable the ECN extension.

5.2.  Tunnel Transport Connection Interactions

   The primary goal of the ECN extension is to enable ECN usage between
   the proxy and the target and have the end-to-end transport react to
   that ECN.  However, there exist different potential models for how to
   provide ECN interactions for the tunnel, i.e. between HTTP client and
   sever.  Which to do depends on how the tunnel is configured and what
   other support one have implemented for the Connect-UDP protocol.

   For HTTP tunnels not using HTTP/3 [RFC9114], HTTP/3 using data
   streams, or HTTP/3 with datagrams but not disabling congestion
   control, the tunnel will consist of one or possibly several chained
   congestion controlled transport connections.  In this case ECN may be
   enabled for each underlying transport connection independently.
   However, it in this case it is not possible to have a one-to-one
   marking between the lower layer ECN marking and the tunneled HTTP
   datagrams and avoid reacting both on the tunnel transport and in the
   end-to-end.  Instead the only real choice to have each HTTP layer hop
   run an ECN marking AQM goverened by what it can transmit over the
   transport connection that marks the ECN field in the HTTP datagram or
   drops the HTTP datagram when a queue builds.  In other words each
   HTTP transport connection is treated as one IP link on the end-to-end
   chain.

   For tunnels using HTTP/3 and Datagram and where the QUIC connection
   is disabling congestion control on the packets containing HTTP
   datagrams, as discsussed in Section 6 of [RFC9298], then the ECN
   marking on the tunneled packets can be propogated between the IP
   packet of the transport connection and the end-to-end packet.  This
   reprensts a specific implementation of IP in IP Tunnels with Tightly
   coupled Shim Headers as discussed in [RFC9601].  This is implemented
   as Feed-Forward-and-Up as discussed in [RFC9599], and MUST use the
   the normal mode on tunnel ingress, and follow the specified default
   behavior on egress as defined by [RFC6040].

5.3.  QUIC Aware Forwarding

   A HTTP endpoint that supports this extension and QUIC Aware
   Forwarding [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy] MUST preserve ECN markings on
   forwarded packets in both directions, to ensure ECN functions end-to-
   end.  Using this extension in combination with the QUIC aware
   forwarding instead of only QUIC aware forwarding also ensure that one
   don't get ECN black holes on some packets, like long header packets
   or for packets sent at any point when the QUIC Aware forwarding isn't
   yet established for short header packets.  Thus supporting both
   ensures a consistent ECN experience.

6.  Open Issues

   As there would be no on the wire overhead to enable this field to
   carry the DSCP one can ask if there is a point to include this.  It
   would however require more work to define.

   Do we need to define a Context ID negotiation Capsule so that if
   another extension in the future defines a capsule to define a context
   ID one can combine it with ECN?

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is request to register one new permanent Field name in the
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry (At time of
   writing residing at: https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/
   http-fields.xhtml).

   Field Name: ECN-Context-ID

   Status: Permanent

   Structured Type: List
