              ECN and DSCP support for HTTPS's Connect-UDP
          draft-westerlund-masque-connect-udp-ecn-dscp-latest

Abstract

   HTTP's Extended Connect's Connect-UDP protocol enables a client to
   proxy a UDP flow from the HTTP server towards a specified target IP
   address and UDP port.  Both QUIC and RTP are transport protocols that
   uses UDP and have support for using ECN and providing the necessary
   feedback.  Thus, there exist a benefit to enable an end-to-end QUIC
   or RTP transport protocol connection/session to be able to use ECN.
   This document specifies how ECN and DSCP can be supported through an
   extension to the Connect-UDP protocol for HTTP.

1.  Introduction

   Connect-UDP as currently defined limits the ECN [RFC3168] exchange
   between the HTTP server and the target.  There is no support for
   carrying the ECN bits between the HTTP Connect-UDP client and the
   HTTP server proxying the UDP flow.  Thus, it is not possible to
   establish the end-to-end ECN flow of information necessary to make
   either ECN classic [RFC3168] or L4S [RFC9484] function.

   Diffserv architecture [RFC2475] enables different network treatment
   of packets.  Connect-UDP as currently defined lacks support for
   carrying the value of the DSCP field [RFC2474] through the tunnel.

   To enable DSCP and ECN usage end-to-end for transport protocols using
   UDP and being proxied using the Connect-UDP extended connect over
   HTTP additional extensions are needed.  This document specifies the
   necessary extension, defining two methods, one possible having no
   additional overhead by encoding only ECN in the context ID, the other
   carrying both DSCP and ECN in the HTTP Datagram payload.  For these
   two extensions negotiation is specified and a new Datagram context
   that carries the DSCP and ECN bits and the UDP payload instead of the
   context defined in [RFC9298].

   An alternative to using this extension would be to use Connect-IP
   [RFC9484], however that results in that one carries a full IP header
   between the HTTP client and HTTP server.  That results in
   significantly more overhead compared to this extension that adds zero
   or one byte for containing both the DSCP and ECN bits.

   To define a solution that can be combined with other contexts and
   avoid having to be redefined for each combination with other
   extensions this defines context IDs that indicates that it carries
   the ECN and DSCP and then is followed by another Context ID.  The ECN
   encoding in the context ID configures three additional Context ID
   values that are bound to a HTTP Datagram payload idefnitying Context
   ID and indicates if the packet was marked with ECT(0), ECT(1), or CE
   respectively.

   An endpoint should not enable both of the alternatives in this
   document as that would lead to confusion on when to use the DSCP
   carrying extension.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECN Encoded in Context ID

   For a likely zero overhead encoding of the ECN bits, the ECN bits can
   be indicated by using different context ID values followed by the
   context that would otherwise have been used, often the basic UDP
   payload context (CID=0) as defined by [RFC9298].

   The core of this solution is to define for a Connect-UDP stream
   define additioanl Context IDs (A, B, and C) that are used to indicate
   the ECN values that are not Not-ECT, i.e. ECT(1), ECT(0), CE
   [RFC3168].  This idea is shown in Table 1.

         +===========+=========+===========+====================+
         | CID Value | ECN bit | ECN Value | Original CID Value |
         +===========+=========+===========+====================+
         |         0 | 0b00    | Not-ECT   | 0                  |
         +-----------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
         |         A | 0b01    | ECT(1)    | 0                  |
         +-----------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
         |         B | 0b10    | ECT(0)    | 0                  |
         +-----------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
         |         C | 0b11    | CE        | 0                  |
         +-----------+---------+-----------+--------------------+

                       Table 1: ECN Encoding Table

   No new CID value is defined to represent Not-ECT, as using a Context
   value without this extension by default would be not-ECT.  Then
   additionally CIDs are defined to represent the combination of an ECN
   value other than Not-ECT and the actual payload identification
   context ID.  If the application used more CID values than just zero,
   then additional CID values will have to be defined.  This extension
   is likely to result in three times additioanl CIDs will be needed in
   the Connect-UDP stream.  We expect that this will be acceptable in
   most cases as a total of 64 CIDs can be encoded as a single byte,
   thus resulting in no packet expansion.  However for applications that
   has more than 16 original CIDs (including zero) it is possible to
   consider using the ECN and DSCP context Section 4 which only double
   the number of CIDs but requires an additional byte in the payload.

   A endpoint enabling this extension MUST define all three of the Not-
   ECT ECN values.  This despite that an ECN application working as
   intened would expect to see only the one ECT value the endpoint uses
   and the CE code.  However, if there are transmission errors or
   erronous remarking in the network, also the other ECT codepoint as
   well as Not-ECT may be needed to transmitt.

   Negotiation of the CID values to use are defined using both HTTP
   headers and Capsulses in Section 4.

4.  DSCP and ECN enabled UDP Proxying Payload

   The HTTP Datagram Payload format is defined in [RFC9484] as depicted
   below.

   UDP Proxying HTTP Datagram Payload {
     Context ID (i),
     UDP Proxying Payload (..)
   }

          Figure 1: ECN enabled UDP Proxying HTTP Datagram Format

   The DSCP and ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload is defined in the
   following way:

 ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload {
   DSCP(6),
   ECN(2),
   UDP Proxying Payload (..) # Payload per another Context ID definition
 }

              Figure 2: ECN carrying UDP Proxying Payload

   DSCP: six bits currently reserved, SHALL be set to zero (0) on
   transmission, and ignored on reception.

   ECN: A two bit field carrying the IP ECN bits as defined by Section 5
   of [RFC3168] to be set or as received on the IP/UDP packet carrying
   the UDP Datagram payload included.

   UDP Proxying Payload: Another UDP Proxying Payload following the ECN
   carrying byte.  This uses another Context ID as negotiated, e.g.
   Context ID 0.  Thus enabling this byte to be combined with any other
   payload.

   This format will use a negotiated context ID that MUST be non-zero.
   It also MUST negotiate what the context ID of the UDP Proxying
   payload included.

5.  Negotiating Extensions Usage

   This section defines capability negotation and Context ID
   configuration for the two defined extensions.

   Note that Context Identifiers are defined as QUIC varints, see
   section 16 of [RFC9000] and do support value up to
   4,611,686,018,427,387,903, which is larger than what an Structure
   Header Integer support, which is limited to 999,999,999,999,999.  We
   forsee no issues with this limitations as context identifiers should
   primiarly be using the single byte representation for efficiency
   reason, i.e. Context Identifers should rarely be above the value 63.

5.1.  ECN Signaled using Context IDs

   To configure the ECN Signaled using Context IDs three context IDs
   need to be configured in relation to a Context ID that identified the
   actual HTTP Datagram Payload.

   Each Actual configuration of an ECN signalled using a four tuple with
   the following format:

   ECN_CID_ASSIGNMENT {
     ECT_1_CID (i),
     ECT_0_CID (i),
     CE_CID (i),
     PAYLOAD_CID (i)
   }

                    Figure 3: ECN CID ASSIGNMENT Format

   ECT_1_CID:  The Context ID used to indicate the payload was marked
      with ECN value ECT(1).

   ECT_0_CID:  The Context ID used to indicate the payload was marked
      with ECN value ECT(0).

   CE_CID:  The Context ID used to indicate the payload was marked with
      ECN value CE.

   PAYLOAD_CID:  The Context ID indicating the actual encoding of the
      start of the HTTP Datagram payload.

5.1.1.  HTTP Structured field

   ECN-Context-ID is an Structured Header Field [RFC9651].  Its value is
   a List consisting of zero or more Inner Lists, where the Inner List
   contains four Integer Items.  The Integer Items MUST be non-negative
   as they are context Identifiers as defined by [RFC9298].  The four
   context IDs are the four defined in Figure 3 in that order.

   When the header is included in a Extended Connect Request it indicate
   first of all support for this ECN extension.  Secondly is may defines
   one or more four tuples of context IDs that is defined for requestor
   to responder direction.  If no context ID four tuples are included
   then this header only indicate support for the extension and it may
   be configured using capsules.

   The responder MAY if the request include the ECN-Context-ID header
   include the header in a response.  If included in a response it
   defines the Context ID used in the responder to requestor direction.

   ECN-Context-ID: (5,6,7,4), (1,2,3,0)

                 Figure 4: Example of ECN-Context-ID header

   The above example indicate supoprt of the ECN signaled using Context
   IDs and defines two sets of Context IDs, ID=5,6,7 (ECT(1), ECT(0),CE)
   combined with Context ID 4, Context ID=1,2,3 which is combined with
   the default ID=0 as defined in [RFC9298], i.e. a plain UDP Payload.

5.1.2.  ECN CID Assignment Capsule

   The DSCP_ECN_CID_ASSIGN capsule is used to assign CID values to the
   DSCP & ECN UDP Proxying payload.

   ECN_CID_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBA_2
     Length (i),
     ECN_CID ASSIGNMENT (..) ...,
   }

                  Figure 5: ECN_CID_ASSIGN Capsule Format

   Type and Length as defined by the HTTP Capsule specification
   Section 3.2 of [RFC9297].  The capsule value is the ECN_CID
   ASSIGNMENT defined above Figure 3.  Thus, the capsule value consists
   of zero or more CID Assignment four tupless.

5.2.  ECN and DSCP enabled UDP Proxying Payload

   This defines the negotiation of the ECN and DSCP enabled UDP Proxying
   Payload extension defined in Section 4.  It defined both an HTTP
   header field (DSCP-ECN-Context-ID) that can be included in the
   Extended Connect request.  It also defines an capsule.

5.2.1.  HTTP Structured Header

   DSCP-ECN-Context-ID is an Structured Header Field [RFC9651].  Its
   value is a List consisting of zero or more Inner Lists, where the
   Inner List contains two Integer Items.  The Integer Items MUST be
   non-negative as they are context Identifiers as defined by [RFC9298].
   The first Integer Item is the Context ID being defined, the second
   Context ID is the Context ID for the payload following the ECN byte.

   When the header is included in a Extended Connect Request it indicate
   first of all support for this ECN extension.  Secondly is may defines
   one or more context IDs that is defined for requestor to responder
   direction.  If no context ID pairs are included then this header only
   indicate support for the extension and it may be configured using
   capsules.

   The responder MAY if the request include the DSCP-ECN-Context-ID
   header include the header in a response.  If included in a response
   it defines the Context ID used in the responder to requestor
   direction.

   DSCP-ECN-Context-ID: (1,4), (2,5), (3,0)

                 Figure 6: Example of ECN-Context-ID header

   The above example indicate supoprt of the ECN byte context and
   defines three Context IDs, Context ID=1 is combined with 4, ID=2 with
   Context ID 5 and ID=3 with the default ID=0 as defined in [RFC9298],
   i.e. a plain UDP Payload.

5.2.2.  DSCP ECN Context ID Assignment Capsule

   The DSCP_ECN_CID_ASSIGN capsule is used to assign CID values to the
   DSCP & ECN UDP Proxying payload.

   DSCP_ECN_CID_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBA_2
     Length (i),
     CID ASSIGNMENT (..) ...,
   }

                Figure 7: DSCP_ECN_CID_ASSIGN Capsule Format

   Type and Length as defined by the HTTP Capsule specification
   Section 3.2 [RFC9297].  The capsule value is defined below.

   CID ASSIGNMENT {
     ASSIGNED_CID (i),
     NEXT_PAYLOAD_CID (i)
   }

                      Figure 8: CID ASSIGNMENT Format

   The capsule value consists of zero or more CID Assignment pair
   values.  Each pair consists of these two fields:

   ASSIGNED_CID: : The CID identifying that the indicated HTTP datagram
   payload starts with the DSCP ECN UDP Proxying Payload.

   NEXT_PAYLOAD_CID:  The CID identifying the following payload in each
      HTTP datagram after the DSCP ECN UDP Proxying Payload.

   This capsule is sent by either endpoints to configure or extend the
   configuration of CIDs which it intends to send.  The receiving HTTP
   endpoint MUST send back its corresponding DSCP_ECN_CID_ASSIGN
   capsule, which may be empty if the peer does not intended to send
   any.

6.  Tunnels and DSCP and ECN marking interactions

6.1.  Tunnel Endpoint Marking

   The Tunnel Endpoint when receiving an IP/UDP packet that is belonging
   to an Connect-UDP request where the ECN+DSCP extension is enabled
   copies the the six DSCP bits and the two ECN field bits from the IP
   header to the DSCP and ECN fields respectively in the HTTP datagram
   payload using the relevant Context ID.  If using the ECN only
   extension the two ECN bits in the incoming IP/UDP packet are used to
   select which CID value should be used.

   For the DSCP+ECN extension a Tunnel endpoint on egress copies the
   DSCP and ECN extension field value into the IP/UDP packet it creates
   for this UDP Proxying payload.  For the ECN extension the CID value
   is used to determine which value to write in the outgoing IP/UDP
   packets ECN field.

   An Tunnel endpoint which is unable to read or set the ECN Field SHALL
   NOT enable the ECN extension.

6.2.  DSCP Remarking Considerations

   The tunnel may interconnect two different adminstrative domains that
   uses the DSCP values differently.  Thus, the endpoints likely need to
   perform remarking of the DSCP field values the same as a inter domain
   router would.  Depending on use cases and deployment the HTTP client
   can be in different actual network domains with different DSCP
   usages.  An HTTP server that based on user identification connects
   the HTTP client to different network domains behind it may also need
   to support multiple external domains.

   The above complications in handling DSCP makes it impossible to
   provide a standarized remarking instruction.  Instead the deployment
   will have to define if remarking is handled by the HTTP server, the
   HTTP client, or both considering the tunnel a specific network domain
   in itself.

6.3.  Tunnel Transport Connection ECN Interactions

   The primary goal of the ECN extension is to enable ECN usage between
   the proxy and the target and have the end-to-end transport react to
   that ECN.  However, there exist different potential models for how to
   provide ECN interactions for the tunnel, i.e. between HTTP client and
   sever.  Which to do depends on how the tunnel is configured and what
   other support one have implemented for the Connect-UDP protocol.

   For HTTP tunnels not using HTTP/3 [RFC9114], HTTP/3 using data
   streams, or HTTP/3 with datagrams but not disabling congestion
   control, the tunnel will consist of one or possibly several chained
   congestion controlled transport connections.  In this case ECN may be
   enabled for each underlying transport connection independently.
   However, it in this case it is not possible to have a one-to-one
   marking between the lower layer ECN marking and the tunneled HTTP
   datagrams and avoid reacting both on the tunnel transport and in the
   end-to-end.  Instead the only real choice to have each HTTP layer hop
   run an ECN marking AQM goverened by what it can transmit over the
   transport connection that marks the ECN field in the HTTP datagram or
   drops the HTTP datagram when a queue builds.  In other words each
   HTTP transport connection is treated as one IP link on the end-to-end
   chain.

   For tunnels using HTTP/3 and Datagram and where the QUIC connection
   is disabling congestion control on the packets containing HTTP
   datagrams, as discsussed in Section 6 of [RFC9298], then the ECN
   marking on the tunneled packets can be propogated between the IP
   packet of the transport connection and the end-to-end packet.  This
   reprensts a specific implementation of IP in IP Tunnels with Tightly
   coupled Shim Headers as discussed in [RFC9601].  This is implemented
   as Feed-Forward-and-Up as discussed in [RFC9599], and MUST use the
   the normal mode on tunnel ingress, and follow the specified default
   behavior on egress as defined by [RFC6040].

6.4.  Tunnel Transport Connection DSCP Interactions

   For HTTP tunnels not using HTTP/3 [RFC9114], HTTP/3 using data
   streams, or HTTP/3 with datagrams but not disabling congestion
   control, the tunnel will consist of one or possibly several chained
   congestion controlled transport connections.  These transport
   connections will only be able to use a single DSCP code point to
   avoid inconsistent network treatment that might confuse the
   congestion controller and retransmission mechanism.  Thus, even if
   the tunneled packets are using different DSCP, the transport
   connection will have to settle for using a single DSCP of suitable
   value.  This unless the Multipath extension for QUIC
   [I-D.ietf-quic-multipath] is used, where each path can have a
   different DSCP value.  In this later case packets with different DSCP
   values could be mapped to different paths with the approparite
   network treatment as indicated by the DSCP value.

   For tunnels using HTTP/3 and Datagram and where the QUIC connection
   is disabling congestion control on the packets containing HTTP
   datagrams, as discsussed in Section 6 of [RFC9298], the QUIC packets
   could be marked using the most suitable DSCP value based on the
   encapsualted packet.  In cases where the tunnel connection is sent in
   a different network domain than the one the tunneled packet was
   received on, a suitable remapping needs to occur to the domain the
   tunnel packet will be sent to.  The HTTP tunnel MUST not coalesce
   different tunneled payloads which are not mapped to the same DSCP in
   the same QUIC packet.

6.5.  QUIC Aware Forwarding

   A HTTP endpoint that supports this extension and QUIC Aware
   Forwarding [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy] MUST preserve ECN markings on
   forwarded packets in both directions, to ensure ECN functions end-to-
   end.  Using this extension in combination with the QUIC aware
   forwarding instead of only QUIC aware forwarding also ensure that one
   don't get ECN black holes on some packets, like long header packets
   or for packets sent at any point when the QUIC Aware forwarding isn't
   yet established for short header packets.  Thus supporting both
   ensures a consistent ECN experience.

7.  Open Issues

   *  Is it the right mechanism to use an HTTP header with no
      configurations to indicate the capability to support later
      configuration using capsules?

8.  IANA Considerations
